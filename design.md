This is a alpha version of the SDK for the One API.

The design principles behind this apis was the following.
 * Use async/await where possible.
 * Mirror the API in code.
 * Dependency injection friendly.
 * Paging and sorting is apart of the function call instead of a filter paramater object.



 TODO:
 * Finish filtering code.
 * Create different filtering objects represent different filtering objects.
 * Add more unit testing (use data driven testing with xUnit.)
